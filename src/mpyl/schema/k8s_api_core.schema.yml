        description: 'The maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the desired
            number of pods. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage
            of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute
            number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Defaults to 25%. Example:
            when this is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately
            when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new
            pods do not exceed 130% of desired pods. Once old pods have been killed,
            new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods
            running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired pods.'

            down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. Defaults to 25%. Example: when
            this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired
            pods immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready,
            old ReplicaSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new
            ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of pods available at all times
            during the update is at least 70% of desired pods.'

          and the controller manager during execution. If no system-wide time zone database
          can be found a bundled version of the database is used instead. If the time
          zone name becomes invalid during the lifetime of a CronJob or due to a change
          in host configuration, the controller will stop creating new new Jobs and
          will create a system event with the reason UnknownTimeZone. More information
