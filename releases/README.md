# Release notes

## MPyL 1.2.0

#### Highlights

#### Automated project.yml upgrades

A new cli command `mpyl projects upgrade` allows you to upgrade your `project.yml` to the latest version. It will
automatically add new sections and fields when necessary.

Future upgrade scripts should be added to `mpyl.projects.versioning`.
#### Kubernetes deploy actions
In `mpyl_config.yaml` the deploy action now needs to be explicitly set.
```yaml
kubernetes:
  deployAction: HelmDeploy
```
There are four deploy actions available:
- `HelmDeploy` - deploys the helm chart
- `HelmDryRun` - runs a helm dry run against the cluster
- `HelmTemplate` - renders a helm chart on the file system to the folder specified in the `helmTemplateOutputPath` property
- `KubectlManifest` - renders the deployment as manifest file specified in the `kubectlManifestOutputPath` property. This manifest can be deployed with a `kubectl -f <path>` command.

#### Image pull secrets
Default image pull secrets now need to be configured globally in `mpyl_config.yml`
```yaml
  deployment:
    kubernetes:
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: 'acme-registry'
```

## MPyL 1.1.0

#### Highlights

#### Hotfix for mapping multiple ports to the same service

Due to a bug in the mapping of multiple ports to the same service, the following configuration:
```yaml
deployment:
  kubernetes:
  portMappings:
    8081: 8081
  traefik:
    hosts:
      ...
      - host:
          all: "Host(`some.other.host.com`)"
        servicePort: 4091
        priority: 1000
```
resulted in `8081` being used as servicePort in the treafik rule instead of `4091`.

#### Release notes

The release notes (as you are reading them now) are generated from the `releases/notes` directory in the project repository.
Whenever a release has changes that require your attention like: new cli commands, new features, breaking changes, upgrade
instructions, etc. they will be included here.

#### Create startup probes by default

When a project is using livenesProbes, but has no startupProbe defined, we resort to creating a startup probe from the
default values defined in the `mpyl_config.yml` file. This is done to prevent the project from being marked as
unhealthy.

#### Fix namespace interpolation in the Traefik default hosts

The default hosts for Traefik are now interpolated with the namespace of the project in test/acceptance/production.
