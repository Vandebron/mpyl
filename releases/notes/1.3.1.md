#### Target specific whitelists

Now have the possibility to specify target specific whitelisting rules.
This means that for the same rule, we can apply different lists of IPs, depending on the target environment:
Change in the `mpyl_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
whiteLists:
  default: [ "VPN" ]
  addresses:
    - name: "VPN"
      all: [ "10.0.0.1" ]
    - name: 'Outside-World'
      all: [ '0.0.0.0/0' ]
    - name: 'K8s-Test'
      all: [ '1.2.3.0', '1.2.3.1' ]
    - name: 'TargetSpecificWhitelist'
      pr: ['1.2.3.4']
      test: ['1.2.3.4']
      acceptance: ['2.3.4.5']
      production: ['3.4.5.6']
```

#### Add support for various kubernetes resources
