#### Tests
- Execute a single sbt `test` command instead of `test:compile` and `test:test` sequentially (removes the need for the experimental thin client)

### Dependency management
- Always re-execute a stage for a project when one or more of their dependencies are modified
- Produce a hash of the modified files even when the stage is cached (so a follow-up commit can be cached)
