### Fix Dagster Kubernetes deployments
- Fixed an issue where Dagster Kubernetes deployments were using the wrong `mpyl_config` value for their Kubernetes context
    - Old scenario: used `cluster_env` 
    - New scenario: uses `context`
    - This change makes sure the correct Kubernetes context is now chosen while deploying

### Revert fix on PrometheusRules alerts description
- A fix was added to allow for variable interpolation in PrometheusRules alerts description.
- As this fix was only added for Helm deployments, and we are now using ArgoCD, this fix is no longer needed and has been reverted.
