# Notable changes
 - `mpyl build jenkins` uses `--follow` by default, as it it's more instructive for first time use
 - `mpyl build jenkins` has `--silent` mode, in which we block until the Jenkins build is finished but filter out the logs
 - rename hidden .mpl folder to .mpyl
 - introduce possibility to filter documentation changes from invalidation logic
