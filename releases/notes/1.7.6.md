#### Use pathlib to determine path of project during discovery
- Using `pathlib` instead of string manipulation to determine the build plan of project avoids name overshadowing like `project_A` and `project_A_B`.

### Upgrading `rich` and `slack` dependencies
- `slack-sdk` from `3.21.3` to `3.33.3`
- `rich` from `13.8.0` to `13.9.4`
