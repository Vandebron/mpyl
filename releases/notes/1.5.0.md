#### Argocd

Add support for an argocd repository and workflow:
- Can be toggled on by setting `kubernetes.deployAction` to 'KubectlManifest' in the `mpyl_config.yaml` file.
- An `argoRepository` and `argoGithub` object have been added to the `vcs` section in the `mpyl_config.yaml` file to
  configure the argocd repository and github repository.
- The `manifest.yaml` file will be created during the deploy step.
- The command to push the k8s manifests to the argocd repository is `mpyl build artifacts push --artifact-type argo`. 
- An additional `deployment.yaml` file will be created in the push command, it contains some extra metadata for argocd.
- A pull request will be created in the configured argocd repository with the created k8s manifest files.
- The folder in the argocd repo structure has the following pattern: `k8s-manifests/{project_name}/{target}/{namespace}/*.yaml`.

#### Manual selection
Include project overrides in list of projects.

#### Multiple deploy targets

Allow multiple deploy targets when using the jenkins cli command.


#### Stage configuration

MPyL can be configured to use an arbitrary set of build stages. Typical CI/CD stages are `build`, `test` or `deploy`.
See `mpyl.steps` for the steps that come bundled and how to define and register your own.
