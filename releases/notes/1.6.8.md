#### Configurable deployment cluster

- Be able to specify a list of target clusters to deploy to
- Be able to specify default targets per environment
- Be able to override the default targets in the `project.yaml`

```yaml
deployment:
  cluster:
    pr: 'leaf-test'
    test: 'test'
    acceptance: 'acce'
    production: 'prod'
```

#### Additional Traefik routes

Be able to define additional, generic Traefik routes in the `project.yaml` that are referenced from the mpyl_config.yaml

project.yaml
```yaml
traefik:
    hosts:
      - host:
          pr: "Host(`payments-{PR-NUMBER}.{CLUSTER-ENV}.nl`)"
          test: "Host(`payments.test.nl`)"
          acceptance: "Host(`payments.acceptance1.nl`)"
          production: "Host(`payments.nl`)"
        tls:
          all: "le-custom-prod-wildcard-cert"
        insecure: true
        whitelists:
          test:
            - "Test"
        additionalRoute: "ingress-intracloud-https"
```

mpyl_config.yaml
```yaml
deployment:
    additionalTraefikRoutes:
      - name: "ingress-intracloud-https"
        clusterEnv:
          pr: "test-other"
          test: "test-other"
          acceptance: "acce-other"
          production: "acce-other"
        middlewares:
          - "intracloud-middleware@kubernetescrd"
        entrypoints:
          - "intracloud"
```

#### Additional Traefik configuration

It is also possible to define the additional traefik configuration in the `mpyl_config.yml`:

```yaml
deployment:
    traefikDefaults:
      httpMiddleware: "traefik-https-redirect@kubernetescrd"
      tls: "le-custom-prod-wildcard-cert"
```
