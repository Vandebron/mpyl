#### Automated project.yml upgrades

A new cli command `mpyl projects upgrade` allows you to upgrade your `project.yml` to the latest version. It will
automatically add new sections and fields when necessary.

Future upgrade scripts should be added to `mpyl.projects.versioning`.
#### Kubernetes deploy actions
In `mpyl_config.yaml` the deploy action now needs to be explicitly set.
```yaml
kubernetes:
  deployAction: HelmDeploy
```
There are four deploy actions available:
- `HelmDeploy` - deploys the helm chart
- `HelmDryRun` - runs a helm dry run against the cluster
- `HelmTemplate` - renders a helm chart on the file system to the folder specified in the `helmTemplateOutputPath` property
- `KubectlManifest` - renders the deployment as manifest file specified in the `kubectlManifestOutputPath` property. This manifest can be deployed with a `kubectl -f <path>` command.

#### Image pull secrets
Default image pull secrets now need to be configured globally in `mpyl_config.yml`
```yaml
  deployment:
    kubernetes:
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: 'acme-registry'
```
